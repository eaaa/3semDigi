You'll need to have Gulp installed. If you already have Gulp installed, you can skip the following line. It is as simple as running:
* `npm install -g gulp`

* Run `npm-install.cmd` to install dev dependencies. Use sudo if needed.

During development mode, run the default task so you'll have watchers and browser sync.
* Run `gulp` to start (Be aware gulp-task is a little slow so give it just 50 second to start, and then it will fire up a new browser-tab and browserSync) :D
